		For those players who want a little more song and dance in the lives of their colonies! This mod introduces a range of performing arts: 
		Theatre:  Colonists can write (Artistic) and perform plays (Social), which are written at sculpting benches.
		Music:    Music can be composed (Artistic) and performed at a piano (Artistic).
		Stand-up: Rehearsed and performed at the microphone stand (Social). 
		Radio: Performances from all of the above will be automatically broadcast if you have a broadcaster, with subscription payments sent in by nearby settlements based on the quality of your broadcast.
		
		Now you can keep your colonists from ever doing a real day's work!
		
		Credits: Original was created by SeveralPuffins, Japanese translation by Proxyer.
